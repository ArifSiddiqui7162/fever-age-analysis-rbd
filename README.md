## 📚 Project Description

This project explores the **association between age groups and types of fever** using statistical methods like **Chi-square test** and **Randomized Block Design (RBD)**. The goal is to identify patterns in fever cases across different age groups and use statistical analysis to draw meaningful, data-driven healthcare conclusions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 Identify which **age groups** are most affected by specific **types of fever**.
- 📊 Analyze the **distribution** and **severity** of fever cases using statistical methods.
- 🏥 Provide **insights** for hospitals and public health authorities.
- 🧪 Suggest targeted **preventive strategies** based on data trends.

---

## 🦠 Fever Types Considered

1. **Viral Fever**
2. **Enteric Fever (Typhoid)**
3. **Dengue**
4. **Influenza-like Illness (ILI)**
5. **NAD (No Abnormality Detected)**

---

## 👥 Age Groups Analyzed

- 14–23 years  
- 24–33 years  
- 34–43 years  
- 44–53 years  
- 54–63 years  
- 64+ years

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. **Chi-square Test of Independence**
- Used to test the association between age group and fever type.
- Result: p-value ≈ 8.92 × 10⁻¹⁶³ ⇒ Significant association found.

### 2. **Randomized Block Design (RBD)**
- Blocks: Age Groups
- Treatments: Types of Fever
- RBD ANOVA → Significant differences found between both age groups and fever types.

### 3. **Post-Hoc Tests**
- **Critical Difference (CD) Test**
- **Tukey’s HSD**
- **Scheffé’s Test**

These tests help determine which fever types significantly differ across age groups.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **NAD and ILI are most prevalent**, especially in older age groups.
- **Viral, Enteric, and Dengue fevers** show increased frequency with age.
- **Influenza-like Illness (ILI)** is more common in younger age groups.
- **Dengue & ILI** show similar patterns across age groups (no significant difference).
- Age and fever type both significantly affect fever distribution.

---

## 🏥 Real-World Applications

- **Hospital Planning**: Optimize bed allocation, resources, and staff.
- **Public Health**: Run targeted awareness campaigns for vulnerable age groups.
- **Policy-Making**: Formulate age-specific healthcare interventions.
- **Data Science**: Foundation for AI-based outbreak prediction models.
